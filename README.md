## Abstract

This master thesis looks at the uses of anglicisms in Metropolitan French,
focusing on two types of media. The first from traditional media: television was
compared to YouTube representing a new generation of media. They were further
divided into two different types of programs: one of news broadcasts and one of TV
shopping programs. While debates surrounding anglicisms in French society abound,
quantitative research on this linguistic phenomenon remains scarce. Anglicisms in
French society are debated at great length, but few linguists have done quantitative
research on them. Notably, prior studies have not examined the frequency of anglicisms
in media.
This research paper tried to answer three questions: what is the frequency of anglicisms
in these two different media and programs? Does the topic or the context of the
discourse influence the percentage of anglicisms employed?
Through a comprehensive exploratory and inferential statistical analysis, the findings
indicate that new social media platforms exhibit a higher frequency of anglicisms
compared to their traditional counterparts and that news broadcast programs tend to
contain fewer anglicisms than TV shopping ones.
However, even if certain topics indicate an impact on the percentage of Anglicisms, on
the other hand, the context variable was not found to be statistically significant. This
study contributes valuable insights into the evolving linguistic landscape of French
media, shedding light on the dynamic interplay between language, technology, and
societal communication trends.
